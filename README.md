# Shopping Cart Project

Welcome to the Shopping Cart project repository! This project is aimed at providing a seamless shopping experience for both local users and administrators. The project consists of two main services: one for local users to purchase items from the site, and another service for administrators to manage items and perform administrative tasks.

## Features

- **Local User Service (Port 8080):** This service allows local users to browse products, add items to their cart, and proceed with the checkout process.
- **Admin Service (Port 8090):** Administrators can access this service to add new products, update existing ones, manage inventory, and perform other administrative tasks.
- **Simultaneous Usage:** Both services can be used concurrently, allowing users and administrators to interact with the system simultaneously without interference.
- **Frontend with Thymeleaf:** The frontend of the application is developed using Thymeleaf, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Payment Integration with PayPal:** Users can make payments securely using PayPal, ensuring a smooth and reliable payment process.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** The backend services are built using Spring Boot, providing a robust and scalable framework for developing enterprise-level applications.
- **Thymeleaf:** Thymeleaf is used for server-side rendering of HTML templates, enabling dynamic content generation and seamless integration with Spring Boot.
- **PayPal Integration:** The application integrates with PayPal's payment gateway to facilitate secure online transactions.
- **Java:** The primary programming language used for backend development is Java, known for its versatility and performance.
- **MySQL/MongoDB:** The application utilizes MySQL/MongoDB databases for storing product information, user data, and other relevant information.
